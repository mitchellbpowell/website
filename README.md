# website

This repository contains the various files for an experimental website. This is a project authored by Mitchell B. Powell, and my aim is to use the Creative Commons CC-0 license wherever possible. 

# licensing

All the Markdown files outside of the `think-like` directory I release under the Creative Commons CC-0 license. I have no interest in restricting anyone's ability to copy my stuff.

Of course, to the extent that I have used short, clearly identified quotes
from materials under traditional copyright, the authors of any such works quoted retain their traditional copyright. I believe all my use of other authors -- such as single-sentence quotes introducing passages -- falls easily within what the laws of the United States and common sense both allow.

In the directory `think-like`, I have posted answers to selected exercises from a Python 3 textbook *How to Think Like
a Computer Scientist: Learning with Python 3*, which can be found at <http://openbookproject.net/thinkcs/python/english3e/>.
It is the work of Peter Wentworth, Jeffrey Elkner, Allen B. Downey, and Chris Meyers (based on 2nd edition by 
Jeffrey Elkner, Allen B. Downey, and Chris Meyers). Its license can be found here: 
<http://openbookproject.net/thinkcs/python/english3e/copyright.html>, and as I believe my answers to selected exercises constitute a derivative work, I am required to release all my answers to the practice problems under the GNU Free Documentation License. You may use version 1.3 or any later version produced by the Free Software foundation.
