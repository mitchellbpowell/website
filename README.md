# website

This repository, licensed under CC0, contains the various files for an experimental website.

This is a project authored by Mitchell B. Powell, and the CC0 license ensures that you can use whatever
I have created here however you like. 

## use of other works

Of course, to the extent that I have used short, clearly identified quotes
from materials under traditional copyright, the authors of any such works quoted retain their traditional copyright.

In the folder think-like, I have posted answers to selected exercises from a Python 3 textbook *How to Think Like
a Computer Scientist: Learning with Python 3*, which can be found at <http://openbookproject.net/thinkcs/python/english3e/>.
It is the work of Peter Wentworth, Jeffrey Elkner, Allen B. Downey, and Chris Meyers (based on 2nd edition by 
Jeffrey Elkner, Allen B. Downey, and Chris Meyers). Its license can be found here:
