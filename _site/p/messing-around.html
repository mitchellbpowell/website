    <p><em>2019-9-13 - 2020-10-29</em></p>

<p>My first foray into programming came when I read an <em>Encyclopedia Brown</em> book (I think that’s what it was), in which the child detective solved a mystery by writing a program in BASIC. I took a bus down to Cincinnati’s downtown public library and got myself a textbook in BASIC.</p>

<p>I quickly discovered that programming in BASIC was very difficult if you don’t have a computer. I messed around with creating programs on paper and “stepping through” them by hand. I don’t remember what all I did with them, but later I did manage to find that my grandmother had some sort of toy computer where you could input basic programs one line at a time, and later a graphing calculator I got in middle school let me write programs in basic, although the language was a bit different from the basic I found in the textbook.</p>

<p>It was around this time (2004?) that a professor at a local college (the now-defunct Cincinnati Christian University) gave our family two ancient 1983 Macs. They had HyperCard, and I and one of my brothers were hooked. We created “websites” for ourselves, and wrote simple programs to control trains and sound effects and such. I say “websites” in quotes because we didn’t have internet access at home, but we worked with what we had.</p>

<p>Since I was obsessed with math at the time, I would write programs related to prime numbers and factoring. A little we got ourselves a Windows machine, still very much used and unable to reach the internet, but it was able to run Visual Basic, which a local high school student gave us on a disk. Among other things, I wrote a program that would find successively closer approximations of <em>pi</em>. Unfortunately, the algorith, which I picked from David Blatner’s <em>The Joy of Pi</em>, required exponentially more processor time for each additional digit of accuracy.</p>

<p>At about fifteen, I drifted away from programming and got into Greek, Hebrew, and Ancient Near Eastern literature. My interactions with computers narrowed a bit, and were limited to installing and fiddling with an occasional linux distro and running some websites. This continues through high school, college, and a job troubleshooting a “buffer system” (think conveyors and storage racks for hot aluminum car wheels). After leaving that position and finishing college, I’ve moved on to running an office for a firm that specializes in fuel branding projects.</p>

<p>In summer 2019, though, my little brother, who used to mess around with HyperCard with me back in the day, suggested that I take up Python 3. I’ve been picking away at it off and on, and it’s been interesting.</p>
