To the extent that I'm legally able to, all material on this website -- mitchellpowell.net -- is hereby released under the Creative Commons [CC-0](https://creativecommons.org/share-your-work/public-domain/cc0) (public domain equivalent) license. If I ever decide to produce something I feel the need to exercise copyright over, I'll put it somewhere else.

The materials in the `think-like` directory consist of responses to prompts in a textbook published under the GNU Free Document License 1.3, and as they may constitute a "derivate work", they are released under the same License, or any later version of the same license produced by the Free Software Foundation.

Each page in this website is labelled with a license statement at the bottom of the page to eliminate any ambiguity about this.

In my life, I've benefitted greatly from free content and free software. I don't know that anyone will find this website useful, but just in case, there it is.
