**Disclaimer**

I am not a medical or statistical expert, and I can't vouch for the accuracy of the reported data coming from the world's governments. But I can run some simple code to put it on graphs.

**The Latest**

Coronavirus continues to dominate the news. Today, the United States jumped from two to six deaths, and we are at around 100 total cases in the country, including about fifty consisting of citizens repatriated from crisis zones. Oddly enough, the WHO this morning reported only sixty-two American cases and no deaths. It would appear that the latest US data has not been finding its way into WHO reports, possibly due to the CDC updating official figures only a few times a week. Whatever the cause, for my US graphs I am no longer using WHO figures.

In the world outside China, cases continue to climb rapidly. Today the WHO reports 8774 cases, more than quadruple the 2069 reported a week ago. The situation inside China continues to rapidly improve. If you add up the growth in the rest of the world with the decrease in China, so far the total number of active infections has been dropping -- China has about three thousand recoveries per day, while the rest of the world produces less than that in new cases. However, if the rest of the world continues quadruping its number of cases weekly, that trend should reverse some time this week. We will know shortly.

**The Graphs**

**Figure 1.** Total number of cumulative cases to date, as reported by the WHO.

**Figure 2.** Same as Figure 1, but on a log plot. People who understand what a log plot is will notice the terrifying roughly straight trajectory of the graph the last four weeks or so.

**Figure 3.** This is the total number of cases every reported minus the dead and recovered, which gives a nice decrease day by day. The decrease is driven by a rapidly improving situation in China, while the bit of leveling off that has appeared the last two days is driven by the worsening situation outside China.

**Figure 4.** Because the WHO numbers are not keeping up with the US spread of the virus, this graph has been constructed from numbers found on, of all places, Wikipedia. What I really need to do is mess around a bit with dealing with CSV files in Python and start working from the Johns Hopkins database. For now, this graph includes _only_ non-repatriated cases.
