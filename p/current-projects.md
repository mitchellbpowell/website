*2020-11-21 - 2021-5-23*

As Covid fades and life returns to usual, I've been thinking through 
what I want to do next. Even though the fuel station branding business 
is unusually busy this year, there's still time that needs to be 
filled, and every now and then I try to fill some of it with something 
productive, or at least interesting.

Back in fall 2020, I was working on putting this website together. 
I'm continuing to polish it a bit, but I've basically got what I want 
up, except for an older half-finished project producing answers to the 
coding exercises in 
_How to Think Like a Computer Scientist: Learning with Python 3_. 
I had been working away at that, learning Python 3 in the process, 
when the Coronavirus hit. Then I started producing daily Covid updates 
([here](/covid/index.html)). I stopped immediately before Ohio locked 
down, at which point Governor DeWine started giving daily Covid 
updates. I wouldn't try to compete with _that_. Later, I started 
producing updates on the Covid situation on Facebook, which mostly 
just went over the stats on the virus as they came out. I'm still 
doing them once a week, and I plan to move them all over onto this 
website as a curiosity. I also plan to finish what I started with 
the Python 3 textbook, so I'll make that one of my current projects.

Another idea I've tossed around for some years is to start studying 
for and taking the actuarial exams. This will be tricky, given that I 
have taken practically no math, with the exception of a Stats class, 
since my junior year of high school, 13 years ago. But I have a natural 
aptitude for math (I was one of just six highschoolers in Ohio to 
qualify for the USAMO back in 2006), and I'm sure I can pick it up. 
My basic strategy is to review high school math, review the college 
math I missed, and just start picking away via the Adapt practice-test 
system. Studying for the actuarial exams in my spare time certainly 
seems like a better investment of time than _not_ studying for the 
actuarial exams in my spare time.

As Covid ends, I'm doing a sort of spring cleaning on my apartment and 
on all the computer documents I've built up so far. After I get that 
squared away, my plan at the moment, on evenings where I'm not 
working, is to alternate -- one evening for Python 3, and one evening 
for actuarial studies. And I'll keep picking away at one and the other 
until and unless I find some other better way to use my time.
