>Ninety percent of *everything* is crud. -- Theodore Sturgeon

Whether or not [Sturgeon's law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sturgeon%27s_law) is correct, we are all faced with the challenge of endless claims on our attention. The sheer abundance of *stuff* out there forces us to pick and choose what we most want to pay attention to, whether that is Derek Parfit's *Reasons and Persons*, our jobs, or an ice cream cone. Every moment, we pay attention to either one thing or a few things, and ignore the rest.

The tragedy of this is how easy it is to miss out on worthwhile things. Just in case someone might find it useful, here is a very incomplete list of things I think are worth paying attention to. To keep me from constantly fiddling with the order, they're alphabetized.

# Against Malaria Foundation

According to [one estimate](https://www.bmj.com/content/351/bmj.h4998), malaria deaths per year dropped from about 840,000 to about 440,000 between 2000 and 2015. The World Health Organization [estimates](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/malaria) that as of 2018 that number was about 405,000. The disease has been wiped out in many countries, and the methods for doing it are not complicated.

One of those methods is to sleep under insecticide-treated mosquito netting if you live in an area where you are in danger. The Against Malaria Foundation provides these mosquito nets, and has earned very high marks from the sorts of people who study these sorts of things.

# Batteries

Although solar energy makes up a rapidly increasing fraction of global electricity, it is only immediately available when the sun is out. This creates various problems associated with the term *[duck curve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duck_curve)*. Those problems would go away if batteries were to get good enough: you store up energy when the sun is up, then use it when it's down.

And progress in batteries also will help determine the future of cars. Right now, battery power is more expensive than gasoline power, though battery power is getting cheaper fast: an 80% drop in prices according to a New York times [article](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/20/business/electric-cars-batteries-tesla-elon-musk.html) from 2020-9-20. If the prices drop far enough, a battery-powered car will be as affordable as a combustion-driven vehicle. If they drop further, it's hard to imagine electric cars wouldn't dominate the market. The article quotes various experts who think battery power might reach financial parity with gasoline sometime around 2023 or 2025. It's worth checking in from time to time to see whether batteries continue to advance so rapidly.

# Breath

As long as we're conscious, we're breathing, with exceptions of four minutes or less. The breath is always there, and paying attention to it can help clear your head and calm you down, should you feel the need to be clearer-headed or calmer.

# Economics

I used to think I understood the economy. Back around 2009, when the Fed started pushing the monetary base upward at a rapid pace, I *knew* that this would cause a dramatic inflation, and that the vast majority of economists were ignoring the simple facts about the money supply. By 2015, the monetary base had quadrupled (graph [here](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/BOGMBASE)). No spike in inflation. It turned out that mainstream economists understood the economy much better than I did as an eighteen-year-old. Since then, I've tried to pay much more careful attention to expert consensus.

# Experts

For just about any field of human study, there are lots of people out there who have made it their life's work to study it. You can save a lot of time and aggravation by listening to these people.

# Effective Altruism

[Effective Altruism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effective_altruism) is a movement associated names like William McAskill, Toby Ord, and Peter Singer. These folks think it is important to try to quantify the amount of good that can be done with a given number of dollars in charitable work. Even if it's not possible to reduce doing good to simple equations, the effort to quantify the issues seems to me worth paying attention to. They're working on a variety of other interesting questions as well.

# FOSS / Free content

Though we still await the Year of the Linux Desktop, open-source software has in some ways taken over the world, playing a major role in everything *but* the desktop. And desktop linux has gotten pretty good. As I type this, I'm using the default text editor of Ubuntu to input Markdown into a text file. The editor highlights the syntax automatically; I didn't have to do anything to set it up that way. It just knows I'm in markdown and helps me out. Firefox, the default browser in Ubuntu, seems to do everything I want it to. When I want to use my Markdown files to build a website, Jekyll is there to do it for me.

Free and open-source software is just one genre of things that happen outside the realm of restrictive copyright. This larger set includes Wikipedia, which works in practice even if not in theory, and the massive and growing collection of books written in 1924 or earlier that one can find on the web. More recent books are more hit-or-miss, but are increasingly available to anyone who has googled "Sci-Hub" or "Library Genesis". Meanwhile, in a zone somewhere between the legality of old public domain books and the illegality of Library Genesis, the Internet Archive is experimenting with something they call "Controlled Digital Lending", which last time I checked was in legal limbo, awaiting court decisions.

This whole bundle of ways that people are building things outside of traditional copyright is worth paying attention to.

# Git

I'd done a few commits before October 2020, but hadn't done much with Git till now. On 2020-10-31, though, I decided I wanted to have version control over this website as it changes, and so I've started using it. I ran through through [a very helpful tutorial](https://product.hubspot.com/blog/git-and-github-tutorial-for-beginners), and the rest has been very googleable, as so many people use Git that whatever I'm confused about has confused some poor soul before, and gotten all sorts of helpful answers.

# gwern.net

It is hard to find a more interesting collection of essays online than at [gwern.net](https://gwern.net). Not only is it interesting, but it's got a great layout. And thanks to Gwern's decision to release the whole website under the CC0 license, anyone who wants to can reuse or adapt the layout freely.

# Longevity

How long things last is worth paying attention to. In a software context, everything is fighting against software rot. If you want something to last, you've got to account for software rot. Over at [gwern.net](gwern.net), Gwern has [some interesting thoughts](https://www.gwern.net/About#long-site) about this. It is from reading Gwern's thoughts that I decided to build this site around a set of markdown files which are converted to relatively simple static HTML pages. I haven't -- so far -- followed Gwern into the world of Haskell, though.

More generally, the average thing is probably about halfway through it's lifespan, almost by definition, which means the average thing will last about as long into the future as it has lasted so far. This is an extremely rough and unreliable rule of thumb, but something that's survived a thousand years has a decent chance of making it another thousand, while something that first happened yesterday might not stick around as long. Thinking too hard about this can lead to some weird places, like the [Doomsday Argument](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doomsday_argument).

# Majority Opinion

Copernicus may have been a vindicated contrarian, but for every Copernicus there is a [Dick Johnson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Mentor_Johnson)  who thinks the earth is hollow and tries to drum up Congressional support for an expedition to the center. Dick Johnson was an actual Vice President of the United States, and he actually did try to drum up Congressional support to explore the hollow earth. Cranks outnumber geniuses, and so it's always a good idea to at least take a serious look at the majority opinion on any given topic. It's also a good idea to see whether the majority opinion among experts in the field differs from the majority opinion of non-experts.

# Mental Health

Two hundred years ago, major sources of suffering for a lot of people included dying children, hunger, and contagious disease. Over time, those sorts of human suffering have greatly decreased in a lot of the world. As we increasingly manage to pick the low-hanging fruit of solving the basic material problems of life for more and more people, this leaves mental health issues taking up a larger and larger share of human suffering, even if average mental health is getting no worse. Tackling the most common mental health issues out there, especially depression and anxiety, is going to be one of the major challenges humanity faces going forward, if for no other reason than our increasing success at knocking out the *other* major challenges.

# Meta-analyses

If you've read an interesting study but haven't looked to see whether there's a relevant meta-analysis, consider looking.

# Null Hypothesis, The

Never underestimate the null hypothesis. Most things don't affect most other things, and p-hacking and its analogues are everywhere. The next time you hear that a single study has found that some obscure vegetable either cures or causes cancer, consider the null hypothesis instead.

# Old Books

Old books have a few things going for them. For one thing, if you come upon an old book, that means someone thought it was worth enough to preserve. The older the book, the stronger the implicit endorsement of centuries of copyists. Hesiod's *Works and Days*, for example, has won the long battle to hold human attention, and survived while the vast majority of ancient literature has long since passed. We find ourselves in the golden era of old books, at least insofar as availability goes. The Internet Archive and HathiTrust have an enormous number of old books.

# Old People

They've had a lot of time and seen a lot of things.

# Polling Averages

They're better than individual polls, which let you fall into the trap of paying the most attention to whatever poll is most interesting.

# Plant-based meats

Impossible Food, Beyond Meat, and others are doing some very interesting things with plant-based meat that could very well wind up changing the way food works. I try to check in on how they're doing every so often.

# Python 3

In summer 2019, when I decided to take up messing around with coding after not doing it for about a decade, a younger brother of mine suggested Python 3. It's surprisingly intuitive, and a lot of things are written in it.

# Reasons and Persons

Derek Parfit's *Reasons and Persons* is an excellent book, and works through a number of philosophical questions associated with altruism and morality. It is dense but manageable for a careful reader, even one without formal training in philosophy. Though I certainly don't expect that too many people will slog through it, I'm hopeful it's might still leave the world a better place than it might otherwise have been.

# Replication Crisis, The

The [Replication Crisis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Replication_crisis) concerns deep questions about how the public and scientists consume statistical information. Perhaps the best result so far is that replication and meta-analysis have been getting a lot more press lately.

# Rice Cookers

They're good for cooking rice. A good ricer cooker -- and I'm not sure there are any bad ones -- runs about $15. Just go to whatever store you'd buy pots and pans at and get the most basic one. They cook up good rice every time, without any need to fuss about timing or quantity of water or what have you.

# SlateStarCodex

SlateStarCodex, depending on how you look at it, either *is* or *was* one of the most interesting parts of the internet, and currently exists in a sort of limbo that it entered in June 2020. It is or was the work of just one person: a pseudonymous psychiatrist named Scott Alexander, who took down his site when, he says, the *New York Times* threatened to doxx him.

# Solar Energy

Wikipedia has a helpful article entitled [Growth of Photovoltaics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Growth_of_photovoltaics), which contains some astounding graphs and charts. From 2000 to 2018, total photovoltaic capacity worldwide doubled approximately nine times, and is now at about 3% of global electricity production, according to the article. If this number is even approximately correct, and it probably is, then we are approximately five doublings away from all the world's electricity being produced by solar cells. Of course, there are some difficult technical challenges to getting there, especially concerning energy storage. For this reasons, it is also worth while to pay attention to batteries.

# Statistics

Statistics are often incomplete, inaccurate, or misleading. Still, if you want to understand something, counting is not a bad place to start. In particular, if you want to understand the world, understanding the concept of *standard deviation* can help quite a bit.

# Total Fertility Rates

The Total Fertility Rate (TFR) is a number which estimates how many children the average woman would have given current fertility rates extended forward indefinitely. If you just think of it as "children per woman" your intuition will be roughly correct for most uses. Global TFR has fallen enormously in recent decades (chart [here](https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/children-per-woman-un?tab=chart&time=1950..2015&country=~OWID_WRL&region=World)), and that has all sorts of implications for gender roles, the economy, government, crime rates, and the environment.

# Wikipedia

Wikipedia is the closest thing the world has to a single standardized set of facts about everything. It still has a large number of issues in the content, but there is nothing out there which we could call "like Wikipedia, but better". There's been a long-running debate about whether it is in decline. It is in some ways a dysfunctional place for editors, and it features way too much silly argument in the creation process, with bad actors given far too much time to cause trouble on the site. On the other hand, it's still the leading encyclopedia. It'll be worth watching how things turn out for it, and whether any other general reference tool surpasses it.
