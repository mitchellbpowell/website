>Ninety percent of *everything* is crud. -- Theodore Sturgeon

Whether or not [Sturgeon's law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sturgeon%27s_law) is correct, we are all faced with the challenge of endless claims on our attention. The sheer abundance of *stuff* out there forces us to pick and choose what we most want to pay attention to, whether that is Derek Parfit's *Reasons and Persons*, our jobs, or an ice cream cone. Every moment, we pay attention to either one thing or a few things, and ignore the rest.

The tragedy of this is how easy it is to miss out on worthwhile things. Just in case someone might find it useful, I've elsewhere produced a [list](worthwhile-things.html) of things worth paying attention to. But this page is not that page. This page is for oddities, curiosities, useless facts, and even some worthwhile things that didn't make the main list.

# Cladistics
[Cladistics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cladistics) classifies living beings in terms of biological relatedness rather than the categories we intuitively use in English. See, for example, the title of Lulu Miller's _Why Fish Don't Exist_.


# Exponential growth: back-of-envelope calculations

The world is made of numbers, among other things, and to understand it you've got to understand numbers, among other things. And in the study of living beings, whether you're talking about biology or economics, having a mental grasp on exponential growth is useful. And to start to intuitively grasp exponents, you're going to need to be able to do rough on-the-fly calculations in your head. And to do that, I think the easiest starting point is to get a little bit familiar with powers of two, powers of ten, and the law of 72.

The powers of ten are well-known, and our numerical system is based on them: 1, 10, 100, 1000, 10,000, ...

The powers of two are a bit harder, but you'd do well to memorize at least the first ten and perhaps the first twenty: 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, and maybe also 2048, 4096, 8192, 16,384, 32,768, 65,536, 131,072, 262,144, 524,288, and 1,048,576. The really critical thing to notice, for mental-math purposes, is that 1000 is about 1024 and 1,000,000 is about 1,048,576. Or, to round things off a bit: 2^10 = 10^3, 2^20 = 10^6, and so on.

This allows you to move back and forth between doublings and common numbers with a little practice. Thus, 2^23 must equal 2^3 times 2^10 times 2^10, and by substituting 10^3 for 2^10, we can say that 2^23 = 2^3 times 10^6, or eight million. If you're following along with a calculator, you'll notice the errors, but don't worry about them for now.

Likewise, you can do the same thing backwards. For something to multiply by 7 billion, for example, how many times must it double? 7 billion is 7 times 10^9, and thus 7 times 2^30. And since 7 is between 2^2 and 2^3, multiplying something by 7 billion requires between 22 and 23 doublings. So a process by which something doubles once a century will take 2200 years and change to multiply 7-billion-fold.

The next tool is the rule of 72, which is the key to converting to and from percentage changes and doubling. The rule is that, if something growth at x percent per unit, then it will take 72 over x units to double. So something that grows 2% per year, like the hourly productivity of workers in technologically leading modern societies, it will double every 36 years. That's about three doublings per century, so in the 200 years of modern economic growth, the richest countries will have seen six doublings of productivity, or 64-fold growth over 200 years.

So you can start working out, in your head, the way that relatively small incremental changes add up to the fundamental transformation of the world. Here's another. Suppose one person has a communicable disease, and the number of people with it grows an average of 10% per week. By the law of 72, that's about a doubling every 10 weeks, five doublings a year, and thus ten doublings every two years. Ten doublings is multiplication by one thousand, so it would take a little over six years for the entire world to catch the disease in question.

More relevantly, consider the coronavirus. If one person had it in November 2019, and it doubled its number of hosts every week, to reach all the world, given unconstrained growth, would have taken 22 to 23 weeks. Of course, there are in the real world complications, like mitigation strategies, contact tracing, weather, masks, and vaccines. But a little simple mental math can help give you an intuition for where things are going if something doesn't stop them.

# Far Side, The

Gary Larson's _The Far Side_ is one of the various curiosities that my grandfather Henderson introduced me to when I was young. He had a book of Gary Larson's comics as part of the his massive personal library. Like many good things, _The Far Side_ has found its way to the internet, where it can be seen here.

# FSI Language Courses

There is a provision in law -- I'm not intimately familiar with the details -- that has the effect of causing works produced by the US government to fall into the public domain. The US government, after all, is funded by tax-payers, and copyright is generally intended to protect the financial interests of authors, so there is an argument that the public has already bought the rights to things produced by the federal government.

The result of this is that certain language self-study courses, originally used for government officials, are allowed to circulate freely on the internet. An example is the [Hebrew course](https://fsi-languages.yojik.eu/languages/FSI/fsi-hebrew.html), which I found very useful back in my Hebrew-studying days. They are not trendy, or beautiful, or complete -- they consist of a text which introduces simple conversations in the language, and a set of tapes, along with instructions on how to study. But if the Hebrew text is any indication, they really do help with grasping the very basics of a language when you're starting.

# GitHub tutorial

(2020-11-5) I recently started keeping track of my website on GitHub ([here](https://github.com/mitchellbpowell/website)), and getting up and running was made easier by a nifty [tutorial](https://product.hubspot.com/blog/git-and-github-tutorial-for-beginners) produced by Meghan Nelson.

# Jaynes, Julian

Perhaps one of the more puzzling and interesting books I've ever read is Julian Jaynes's _The Origin of Consciousness in the Breakdown of the Bicameral Mind_. Drawing extensively on ancient literature, Jaynes outlines a theory of what consciousness is, where it came from, and how very ancient and more modern people's minds differ. I find it impossible to accept that his theory is correct -- it seems outlandish and difficult to prove -- but it's difficult not to think that Jaynes was on to _something_.

# Jimmy

The English name *Jimmy* must be derived from *Jim*. And *Jim*, in turn, is a nickname for *James*. In older English, James was spelled *Iames*, before "J" was invented. That came from the French name *Iames*. The *-co-* just got swallowed up in the shortening, while the *-es* is just a common way for Old French masculine words to end. The French name, in turn, was a shortened version of the Vulgar Latin *Iacomus*. *Iacomus*, in turn, was a modified version of *Iacobus*, as it appeared in Late Latin. The Latin term comes from Greek Ἰάκωβος, *Iakobos*. And that comes from the Hebrew יַעֲקֹב, which is pronounced something like *Yaʿakov*. 

*Yaʿakov* to "Jimmy" is a long march, but it happens little by little.

# Reading direction in English

It is a commonplace claim, and almost entirely true, that Hebrew is read from right to left, while English is read from left to right. But read this: "\$5". If you read it as "five dollars", you read the item on the right, then the item on the left. Language rules are made to be broken.

# Life expectancy: a brief note

It is often said that, in 1850 or two thousand years ago or whenever, life expectancy was 28 or 43 or what have you, and that therefore a 25-five-year-old was "old" in those days. This is then used to make some sort of observation about early marriage, or divorce, or life insurance, or some other topic. This line of talking contains one truth and one major misconception, and it revolves around a confusion of the typical with the mathematical average (mean).

Consider the case of a hypothetical society in which half of the people who are born die at two years old of the, say, _two-year-old flu_, while the other half survive their toldlerhood and die at sixty-eight. We would not say, in a society like that, that a thirty-three-year-old was an old person, with two years left to live. A thirty-three-year-old would still be fairly young.

# Logical quotations

I am a proud American, and I love my country. Still, I don't like what we do with quotation marks, where commas and other bits that aren't part of the quotation in any logical sense. In the ongoing effort to promote a more perfect union for ourselves and our posterity, I plan on using [logical quotation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Manual_of_Style#Punctuation_inside_or_outside) whenever I can get away with it.

# Velikovsky, Immanuel

One of the many interesting curiosities that my late grandfather Henderson pointed me towards was book called _Worlds in Collision_ by the extraordinarily eccentric Immanuel Velikovsky, who combined a creative and well-read mind with a fundamental inability to understand how the real world works and produced fascinating attempts at re-writing history. If you enjoy that sort of thing, you might enjoy _Worlds in Collision_.

# WP:PAG

I used to edit quite a bit for Wikipedia, until I got tired of it. In that time, I became familiar with Wikipedia's Policies and Guidelines, known by the shortcut [WP:PAG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Policies_and_guidelines). If you ever wondered how such a massive site maintains a more or less consistent styles and keeps a pretty decent quality, WP:PAG is part of it.
