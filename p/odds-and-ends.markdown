>Ninety percent of *everything* is crud. -- Theodore Sturgeon

Whether or not [Sturgeon's law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sturgeon%27s_law) is correct, we are all faced with the challenge of endless claims on our attention. The sheer abundance of *stuff* out there forces us to pick and choose what we most want to pay attention to, whether that is Derek Parfit's *Reasons and Persons*, our jobs, or an ice cream cone. Every moment, we pay attention to either one thing or a few things, and ignore the rest.

The tragedy of this is how easy it is to miss out on worthwhile things. Just in case someone might find it useful, I've elsewhere produced a [list](worthwhile-things.html) of things worth paying attention to. But this page is not that page. This page is for oddities, curiosities, and useless facts.

# Jimmy

The English name *Jimmy* must be derived from *Jim*. And *Jim*, in turn, is a nickname for *James*. In older English, James was spelled *Iames*, before "J" was invented. That came from the French name *Iames*. The *-co-* just got swallowed up in the shortening, while the *-es* is just a common way for Old French masculine words to end. The French name, in turn, was a shortened version of the Vulgar Latin *Iacomus*. *Iacomus*, in turn, was a modified version of *Iacobus*, as it appeared in Late Latin. The Latin term comes from Greek Ἰάκωβος, *Iakobos*. And that comes from the Hebrew יַעֲקֹב, which is pronounced something like *Yaʿakov*. 

*Yaʿakov* to "Jimmy" is a long march, but it happens little by little.

# Reading direction in English

It is a commonplace claim, and almost entirely true, that Hebrew is read from right to left, while English is read from left to right. But read this: "\$5". If you read it as "five dollars", you read the item on the right, then the item on the left. Language rules are made to be broken.

# Logical quotations

I am a proud American, and I love my country. Still, I don't like what we do with quotation marks, where commas and other bits that aren't part of the quotation in any logical sense. In the ongoing effort to promote a more perfect union for ourselves and our posterity, I plan on using [logical quotation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Manual_of_Style#Punctuation_inside_or_outside) whenever I can get away with it.

# WP:PAG

I used to edit quite a bit for Wikipedia, until I got tired of it. In that time, I became familiar with Wikipedia's Policies and Guidelines, known by the shortcut [WP:PAG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Policies_and_guidelines). If you ever wondered how such a massive site maintains a more or less consistent styles and keeps a pretty decent quality, WP:PAG is part of it.
