>What sort of writing could you create if you worked on it (be it 
ever so rarely) for the next 60 years? What could you do if you 
started now? 
-- [Gwern Branwen](https://www.gwern.net/About#long-site)

Early in 2021, I'll be thirty. There is a decent chance I'll be 
around still in 2081. The 
[actuarial tables](https://www.ssa.gov/oact/STATS/table4c6.html) 
imply a 19% chance for me, but that's assuming death rates stay 
exactly where they are in coming decades, rather than falling as 
they have through most of history. In any case, even if I don't have 
sixty years left in me, the 50% odds give me another 48 years -- till 
about 2068. I've been writing things, off and on, since about the 
sixth grade, and even though I have no ambitions to be a writer I do 
occasionally produce something I'd like to keep around.

This website is a place to keep things I intend to have around and visible
long-term. Taking a cue from Gwern, I'm trying to build the set of files that
make up the site in a manner that makes them most likely to continue being
useful throughout my lifetime. On the technical side, that means I'm writing
them in Markdown, a format which I think is around to stay. 

I'm using Jekyll to convert Markdown to HTML before uploading the files. In the
long run, though, as long as I have the Markdown files, I can always use some
other tool later. Markdown to HTML conversion is a problem with multiple
solutions, so this system is unlikely to have major problems with software
compatibility down the road. I'm not keeping this stuff in a Wordpress database
or anything. Even in the unlikely event that every software tool for reading
Markdown were to disappear, the markdown files themselves are human-readable.

Along the same lines, I'm building this as a static site, out of HTML and
images. In the short run, using something like Latex via Javascript to render
equations or similar things might seem convenient, but images aren't going away.
Software comes and goes, but text and images are more durable.

I'm putting all this stuff up on my own domain rather than Wordpress or Blogspot
or what have you because I don't want my content to depend on someone else's
continuing to exist, and it lets me do this without adds. Likewise, I'm holding
the site in an Amazon S3 bucket because S3 is likely to stick around, I don't
have to worry about maintaining a physical server, and if S3 ever does go away
or change I've got a static collection of files I need to move somewhere else in
a fairly easy operation, rather than anything more complex.

In addition to keeping the source files in the bucket and in my own computer,
I've also got them [on GitHub](https://github.com/mitchellbpowell/website), and
each page has a content license at the bottom so that no one will ever have any
doubts about their right to copy or host the content.
