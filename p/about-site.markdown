In October 2020, I was reading up on this “cloud” business that all the cool kids are talking about, and learned that Amazon gives away little bits of various cloud services with its [AWS "Free Tier"](https://aws.amazon.com/free/). I started messing around with it and discovered that you can run a website out an [S3 bucket](https://searchaws.techtarget.com/definition/AWS-bucket). This little website is the result.

If there is one person whose personal website I most admire, it's Gwern Branwen's of [gwern.net](gwern.net), who seems to be full of interesting ideas. One of his ideas is that, because formats and services experience [bitrot]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_rot), it's best, if one is writing anything worthwhile at all, to strategize about how to make one's website durable. And one major strategy for this is to have a relatively simple architecture in which everything is based on a collection of files in an easy-to-use and non-exotic format. You can read more about this [here](https://www.gwern.net/About#long-site).

Branwen's site is beautifully laid out, and he's obviously put a great deal of thought into it. While I'd ever like to get there, for now I'm fiddling around a bit here and there. But the main idea that I'm taking from him right now is that I'm building this site as a collection of markdown files at its core, which are then converted web pages for display. That way the core set of files is written in a language which is unlikely to go away any time soon, and they will still be usable even if they were opened and read by someone with no knowledge of Markdown. Markdown is also a pleasure to write in, as I've done a lot of Wikipedia editing and it seems intuitively ... right.
