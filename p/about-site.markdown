>What sort of writing could you create if you worked on it (be it ever so rarely) for the next 60 years? What could you do if you started now? -- [Gwern Branwen](https://www.gwern.net/About#long-site)

This website is a place to keep things I intend to have around and visible long-term. Taking a cue from Gwern, I'm trying to build the set of files that make up the site in a manner that makes them most likely to continue being useful throughout my lifetime. On the technical side, that means I'm writing them in Markdown, a format which I think is around to stay, and even if it isn't is basically human-readable.

I'm using Jekyll to convert Markdown to HTML before uploading the files. In the long run, though, as long as I have the Markdown files, I can always use some other tool later. Markdown to HTML conversion is a problem with multiple solutions, so this system is unlikely to have major problems with software compatibility down the road. I'm not keeping this stuff in a Wordpress database or anything.

Along the same lines, I'm building this as a static site, out of HTML and images. In the short run, using something like Latex via Javascript to render equations or similar things might seem convenient, but images aren't going away. Software comes and goes, but text and images are more durable.

I'm putting all this stuff up on my own domain rather than Wordpress or Blogspot or what have you because I don't want my content to depend on some kind of website continuing to exist, and it lets me do this without adds. Likewise, I'm holding the site in an Amazon S3 bucket because S3 is likely to stick around, I don't have to worry about maintaining a physical server, and if S3 ever does go away or change I've got a static collection of files I need to move somewhere else in a fairly easy operation, rather than anything more complex.

In addition to keeping the source files in my own computer, I've also got them [on GitHub](https://github.com/mitchellbpowell/website), and each page has a content license at the bottom so that no one will ever have any doubts about their right to copy or host the content.
