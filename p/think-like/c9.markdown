Chapter 9 of _[How to Think Like a Computer Scientist: Learning with Python 3](http://openbookproject.net/thinkcs/python/english3e/)_, has just one little exercise at the end that requires writing code:

_Weâ€™ve said nothing in this chapter about whether you can pass tuples as arguments to a function. Construct a small Python example to test whether this is possible, and write up your findings._

Here's a simple example:

{% highlight ruby %}
def tupleply(tuple):
    """Multiply the elements of a tuple."""
    return tuple[0] * tuple[1]

sample_tuple = (2, 5)
print(tupleply(sample_tuple))
{% endhighlight %}

Sure enough, you can pass a tuple as an argument to a function.
