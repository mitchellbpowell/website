*2019*

Below are exercises from chapter 3 of *[How to Think Like a Computer Scientist:
Learning with Python 3](index.html)*. The bits in italics are from the book;
the code is my solutions.

# 3.8.1 -- Simple for loop

*Write a program that prints* `we like Python's turtles!` *1000 times.*

{% highlight ruby %}
for x in range(1000):
    print("We like Python's turtles!")
{% endhighlight %}

# 3.8.3 -- For loop using a list

*Write a program that uses a for loop to print*

`One of the months of the year is January`  
`One of the months of the year is February` ...

{% highlight ruby %}
months = ["January", "February", "March", "April", "May", "June", "July", \
    "August", "September", "October", "November", "December"]

for month in months:
    print("One of the months of the year is " + month + ".")
{% endhighlight %}

# 3.8.5 -- Basic math with a list

*Assume you have the assignment* `xs = [12, 10, 32, 3, 66, 17, 42, 99, 20]`

*Write a loop that prints each of the numbers on a new line.*

{% highlight ruby %}
xs = [12, 10, 32, 3, 66, 17, 42, 99, 20]
for x in xs:
    print(x)
 {% endhighlight %}
 
 *Write a loop that prints each number and its square on a new line.*
 
 {% highlight ruby %}
 xs = [12, 10, 32, 3, 66, 17, 42, 99, 20]
for x in xs:
    print(str(x) + " squared is " + str(x**2) + ".")
{% endhighlight %}

*Write a loop that adds all the numbers from the list into a variable called*
`total`. *You should set the* `total` *variable to have the value* `0` *before
you start adding them up, and print the value in* `total` *after the loop has
completed.*

{% highlight ruby %}
xs = [12, 10, 32, 3, 66, 17, 42, 99, 20]
total = 0
for x in xs:
    total = total + x
print(total)
{% endhighlight %}

*Print the product of all the numbers in the list.*

{% highlight ruby %}
xs = [12, 10, 32, 3, 66, 17, 42, 99, 20]
total = 1
for x in xs:
    total = total * x
print(total)
{% endhighlight %}

# 3.8.6 -- Drawing regular polygons with turtles

*Use for loops to make a turtle draw these regular polygons (regular means all
sides the same lengths, all angles the same):*

*An equilateral triangle*

{% highlight ruby %}
def draw_regular(name, sides, length):
    """ Takes a turtle as name, an integer as sides, and a number as length.
    Causes the turtle to draw a regular polygon with that number of sides, 
    in which each side is of length 'length'."""

    # Draws a side, then turns, for however many sides we need.
    for x in range(sides):
        name.forward(length)
        name.left(360 / sides)

import turtle               # Lets us work with turtles
wn = turtle.Screen()        # Gives us a screen to work on
tess = turtle.Turtle()      # Gives us a turtle on that screen

draw_regular(tess, 3, 50)   # The line that chooses what to draw

wn.mainloop()               # Holds the screen open till the user closes it.
{% endhighlight %}

Because the program above works by calling a function set up to draw a regular
polygon with any given number of sides, we can draw different polygons simply
by tweaking  the second argument in line 15.

*A square*

Simply change line 15 to `draw_regular(tess, 4, 50)`.

*A hexagon*

`draw_regular(tess, 6, 50)`

*An octagon*

`draw_regular(tess, 8, 50)`

# 3.8.7 -- Visualizing a random walk

*A drunk pirate makes a random turn and then takes 100 steps forward, makes
another random turn, takes another 100 steps, turns another random amount, etc.
A social science student records the angle of each turn before the next 100
steps are taken. Her experimental data is `[160, -43, 270, -97, -43, 200, -940,
17, -86]`. *(Positive angles are counter-clockwise.)  Use a turtle to draw the
path taken by our drunk friend.*

{% highlight ruby %}
import turtle
wn = turtle.Screen()
pirate = turtle.Turtle()

turns = [160, -43, 270, -97, -43, 200, -940, 17, -86]

for turn in turns:
    pirate.left(turn)
    pirate.forward(100)

wn.mainloop()
{% endhighlight %}

*Enhance your program above to also tell us what the drunk pirateâ€™s heading is
after he has finished stumbling around. (Assume he begins at heading 0).*

*We can do this by adding a* `heading` *variable, and then updating it every
time we turn the pirate. And, while we're at it, we might as well have some
comments in the code.*

{% highlight ruby %}
# Make a simulated pirate and a place for him to stumble around.
import turtle
wn = turtle.Screen()
pirate = turtle.Turtle()

# The raw data about how he stumbled.
turns = [160, -43, 270, -97, -43, 200, -940, 17, -86]

# This variable will keep track of our pirate's heading
heading = 0

# Simulate the actual stumbling around.
for turn in turns:
    # The pirate turns.
    pirate.left(turn)
    # We update which way he's facing.
    heading = heading + 1
    # He walks a suspiciously consistent number of steps in a straight line.
    pirate.forward(100)

# Keep the screen open till the user closes it.
wn.mainloop()
{% endhighlight %}

# 3.8.11 -- Drawing a pentagram

*Write a program to draw a shape like this:*

![pentagram](../../i/2.png)

{% highlight ruby %}
# Set up a turtle on a screen.
import turtle
wn = turtle.Screen()
tess = turtle.Turtle()

# Customize speed and pen thickness.
tess.speed(3)
tess.pensize(3)

# Draw the actual shape
for x in range(5):
    tess.forward(200)
    tess.right(144)

# Make the turtle hide so just the shape displays.
tess.hideturtle()

# Hold the window open till the user closes it.
wn.mainloop()
{% endhighlight %}

# 3.8.12

*Write a program to draw a face of a clock that looks something like this:*

![turtle clock](../../i/3.png)

{% highlight ruby %}
# Set up screen, turtle, and light green background.
import turtle
wn = turtle.Screen()
wn.bgcolor("lightgreen")
tess = turtle.Turtle()
tess.color("blue")
tess.shape("turtle")
tess.pensize(2)

# The turtle will need to make twelve 'hands' of 
# the clock, turning thirty degrees each time.
for x in range(12):
    tess.left(30)
    tess.penup()
    tess.forward(70)
    tess.pendown()
    tess.forward(7)
    tess.penup()
    tess.forward(13)
    tess.stamp()
    tess.backward(90)

# Hold the screen open till the user closes it.
wn.mainloop()
{% endhighlight %}
