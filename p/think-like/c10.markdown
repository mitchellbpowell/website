Below are exercises from chapter 10 of _[How to Think Like a Computer Scientist: Learning with Python 3](index.html)_. The text in italics comes from the textbook, and the code (except where it is obviously part of the textbook's prompt) is my solutions.

## 10.6.1 -- Arbitrary addition to a stoplight simulator

_Add some new key bindings to the first sample program:_

- _Pressing keys R, G or B should change tess’ color to Red, Green or Blue._
- _Pressing keys + or - should increase or decrease the width of tess’ pen. Ensure that the pen size stays between 1 and 20 (inclusive)._
- _Handle some other keys to change some attributes of tess, or attributes of the window, or to give her new behaviour that can be controlled from the keyboard._

We can do this like so. Note that decreasing or increasing the pen size has no visible effect on what's going on on the screen visually. I tested it with some print statements earlier, but pulled them out later. It's basically a useless feature, other than as an exercise. Just for giggles, I added functions to shrink and grow tess, and bound them to the s and d keys.

## 10.6.3 -- Two philosophies of traffic lights

_In an earlier chapter we saw two turtle methods,_ `hideturtle` _and_ `showturtle`_, that can hide or show a turtle. This suggests that we could take a different approach to the traffic lights program. Add to your program above as follows: draw a second housing for another set of traffic lights. Create three separate turtles to represent each of the green, orange and red lights, and position them appropriately within your new housing. As your state changes occur, just make one of the three turtles visible at any time. Once you’ve made the changes, sit back and ponder some deep thoughts: you’ve now got two different ways to use turtles to simulate the traffic lights, and both seem to work. Is one approach somehow preferable to the other? Which one more closely resembles reality — i.e. the traffic lights in your town?_

I will leave the pondering for more philosophical minds, and who knows whether my town's traffic lights match yours? But as far as code goes, this will work:

## 10.6.4 -- Make the dim lights show

_Now that you’ve got a traffic light program with different turtles for each light, perhaps the visibility / invisibility trick wasn’t such a great idea. If we watch traffic lights, they turn on and off — but when they’re off they are still there, perhaps just a darker color. Modify the program now so that the lights don’t disappear: they are either on, or off. But when they’re off, they’re still visible._

The way this wording is written seems to presuppose that we're only working with the three-turtle traffic light. So let's alter the code to only have that one traffic light. And then the basic mechanism here is to replace "showturtle" and "hideturtle" with color changes. One could probably fiddle indefinitely with the colors, but this is enough to show the basic idea:

## 10.6.5 -- Please an eccentric billionaire

_Your traffic light controller program has been patented, and you’re about to become seriously rich. But your new client needs a change. They want four states in their state machine: Green, then Green and Orange together, then Orange only, and then Red. Additionally, they want different times spent in each state. The machine should spend 3 seconds in the Green state, followed by one second in the Green+Orange state, then one second in the Orange state, and then 2 seconds in the Red state. Change the logic in the state machine._

Presumably there's some very unusual municipality experimenting with something here. Very well. There's basically two changes we need to make. We add in a new state, which illuminates green plus orange. Then we use a variable, `time_to_change`, which will determine how long each state holds. We'll use that variable at the end of the `advance_state_machine` function to time when the function calls itself.
