*2019-2020*

I've been enjoying a textbook by Peter Wentworth, Jeffrey Elkner, Allen B.
Downey, and Chris Meyers: [How to Think Like a Computer Scientist: Learning
with Python 3](http://openbookproject.net/thinkcs/python/english3e/). It's
under the GNU Free Documentation License 1.3, so, even though the book has not
been edited since 2012, anyone who wants to can create their own revision.

If anyone does want to create their own revision, [here are some
suggestions](possible-revisions.html).

I'm working on posting my solutions to selected exercises:

* [Chapter 2](c2.html)
* [Chapter 3](c3.html)
* [Chapter 4](c4.html)
* [Chapter 5](c5.html)
* [Chapter 6](c6.html)
* [Chapter 7](c7.html)
* [Chapter 8](c8.html)
* [Chapter 9](c9.html)
* [Chapter 10](c10.html)
* [Chapter 11](c11.html)
