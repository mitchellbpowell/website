*2019-2020*

I've been enjoying a textbook by Peter Wentworth, Jeffrey Elkner, Allen B. Downey, and Chris Meyers: *[How to Think Like a Computer Scientist: Learning with Python 3](http://openbookproject.net/thinkcs/python/english3e/)*. It's under the GNU Free Documentation License 1.3, so, even though the book has not been edited since 2012, anyone who wants to can create their own revision.

If anyone does want to create their own revision, some suggestions are [here](/possible-revisions.html).

Below, I plan to post my solutions to selected exercises.
