>Ninety percent of *everything* is crud. -- Theodore Sturgeon

Whether or not [Sturgeon's law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sturgeon%27s_law) is correct, we all face the endless claims on our attention. The sheer abundance of *stuff* out there forces us to pick and choose what we most want to pay attention to, whether that is Derek Parfit's *Reasons and Persons*, our jobs, or an ice cream cone. Every moment, we pay attention to either one thing or a few things, and ignore the rest.

The tragedy of this is how easy it is to miss out on worthwhile things. Just in case someone might find it useful, I've elsewhere produced a [list](worthwhile-things.html) of things worth paying attention to. But this page is not that page. This page is for oddities, curiosities, useless facts, and even some worthwhile things that didn't make the main list.

# Table of contents

# BASIC

My first programming language was BASIC. I wrote simple math programs, mostly. At first, I wrote them on paper, not having any kind of computer they could work on, and then I would mentally step through them. They were an interesting sort of logic puzzle. I did eventually learn that my grandmother had a sort of children's toy computer with a one-line console that one could enter BASIC programs into and have them run, and later I got a graphing calculator that used some variant of BASIC as well. Because I tended to get my information from libraries, I didn't realize at the time that BASIC had fallen out of widespread use a few years before I was born. When I found out, I promptly took a bus to the local public library, checked out a book on C++, and tried programming on paper with *that*, and boy, did that not go well! 

# Berners-Lee, Tim

It's widely known that Tim Berners-Lee produced the first modern website. However, it's perhaps not as well known that it's still online, and you can go see it [here](http://info.cern.ch/).

# China's economy

_2020-11-22_

Singapore's rapid transition from very poor to very wealthy has not been equalled by any country I know of. But Singapore is a small country, with about six million inhabitants. For a country that has rapidly pulled a very large number of people out of deep poverty, the greatest example in the modern world is China. This nation of 1.4 billion people has a GDP per capita, in current US dollars, of \$11,429 as of 2019. This is up from \$452 in 1960, which comes to an average annual increase of 5.6%. However, the last ten years after seen a per capita growth rate of just 2.7% on average. (Values calculated from World Bank [numbers](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.PCAP.CD?view=chart).)

As China's transformation slows, perhaps the next major story to be told in the elimination of poverty is that of India. India still trails behind China, at about \$2,104 of per-capita income as of 2019, up from $82 in 1960. It started behind China and remains behind China -- its growth rate on average the last sixty years has been about the same. But over the last ten years, its growth rate has been more than double China's. If this continues, we will see India catching up, year by year, closer to where China is. This would draw hundreds more millions of people out of poverty and readjust the global balance of power.

# Cladistics
[Cladistics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cladistics) classifies living beings in terms of biological relatedness rather than the categories we intuitively use in English. See, for example, the title of Lulu Miller's _Why Fish Don't Exist_.

# Dennett, Daniel

Daniel Dennett is one of the more interesting philosophers alive today. You might enjoy his _Intuition Pumps and Other Tools for Thinking_.

# DOS

*2020-11-22*

I weep for the generation growing up now, as they might go their whole lives without interacting with DOS. Mind you, I'm no child of the DOS era myself -- I was born in 1991, and Microsoft had already released Windows back in 1985. But I did come into this world late enough that DOS was still hanging around -- on an old but still working computer in my grandfather's basement, running the electronic card catalogue at the Cincinnati Public Library, tracking orders at MacDonalds. It was around _just_ enough to make it obvious that GUI's weren't synonymous with operating systems; they were an innovation. They were a choice. And the basic, underlying systems that ran computers were made of something much like text -- the little buttons and menus were just a pretty shell over something more abstract.

I don't really know that today's youth will miss anything necessary by not seeing DOS in day-to-day life. It's possible I'm just being a cranky old geezer and that previous generations would have said similar things about smoke signals, or loud beeping noises, or punch cards, or whatever it was early computers ran on.

# English as a global language

_2020-11-22_

Greek continued to be a language in widespread use in the Eastern Roman Empire well after Greek political power had been superseded by Rome. Latin continued to be the language of scholarship and international relations in Western Europe long after the fall of the Roman Empire. Indeed, Portuguese, Spanish, Italian, and French are all derived from Latin rather than from whatever pre-Latin languages were indigenously spoken in those regions. Some people think that the United States is on its way out as the leading superpower, but even if this is so, it does not mean that English will rapidly give way to some other language.

Some people think Mandarin Chinese is the future global language. But there is still little evidence of large numbers of people outside China adopting it. Meanwhile, in China itself hundreds of millions of people have had some kind of sustained exposure to English, even if fluency is less common. Meanwhile, in India, the legal system conducts its business in English, and the use of English is rapidly spreading throughout the country. Pew Research ([source](https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2015/10/08/more-than-any-other-foreign-language-european-youths-learn-english/)) finds that the great bulk of European children are taught English in school (77%). 

The internet and globalization more broadly are leading to an incredible consolidation of languages. 
In a winner-takes all dynamic, a global world pushes people to learn more widely-spoken languages and leave behind less-used languages. A relative of mine is a missionary working to translate the Bible into a language in Papua New Guinea. A few decades ago, when she began, there were about seven hundred speakers. Today, most of the young people in the three villages where the language exists do not speak their parents' language very fluently, but speak a local variant of English. By the time she finishes her project, if she ever does, it is possible that her Bible will be the last, and first, piece of literature ever written in a language to die out over the next few decades.

This story is repeating itself all over the world. Filipino teenagers frequently speak to one another in English, and President Duterte frequently gives speeches in which he veers back and forth between Tagalog and English apparently at random. Somewhere close to two billion people worldwide speak English, about a quarter of the world population. Meanwhile, the Chinese government [estimates](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-23975037) that 30% of _Chinese_ people still do not speak Mandarin as of 2014.

The future is hard to predict, but English has at this point acquired widespread enough use that I think it will continue to increase in use worldwide for the rest of my life. Even if the United States loses its status as a global leader -- even if every American somehow disappeared -- I think English has acquired enough status as a cornerstone of international relations, business, and the internet that it's too late to stop it from becoming a language spoken, to one degree or another, by almost everyone worldwide. It's a winner-take-all situation where widespread use begets more widespread use, and it looks to me like English has already won the battle for global dominance in principle. The quadrupling of English use still ahead is just two more doublings to go after the approximately eight doublings in English usage that have occurred in the past five centuries.

There are some who say that widespread Spanish-speaking immigration is somehow going to remove English from its status as the language of the United States. This is nonsense. I came to the United States at five with a five-year-old's fluent command of Spanish, and now I don't talk Spanish too well. This is what happens when small children come to the US speaking Spanish. True, some adults never do quite get the hang of English, just as previous generations of Germans, Poles, and Italians didn't all become English-speakers. But their children did, and do. There is no realistic scenario in which huge numbers of Spanish-speaking immigrants and their children for multiple generations do not manage to learn English. Any increase in Hispanic immigration, from a language standpoint, is an increase in the number of English-speakers in the United States: if not immediately, then over the following decades. 

# Exponential growth: <br>back-of-envelope calculations

The world is made of numbers, among other things, and to understand it you've got to understand numbers, among other things. And in the study of living beings, whether you're talking about biology or economics, having a mental grasp on exponential growth is useful. And to start to intuitively grasp exponents, you're going to need to be able to do rough on-the-fly calculations in your head. And to do that, I think the easiest starting point is to get a little bit familiar with powers of two, powers of ten, and the law of 72.

The powers of ten are well-known, and our numerical system is based on them: 1, 10, 100, 1000, 10,000, ...

The powers of two are a bit harder, but you'd do well to memorize at least the first ten and perhaps the first twenty: 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, and maybe also 2048, 4096, 8192, 16,384, 32,768, 65,536, 131,072, 262,144, 524,288, and 1,048,576. The really critical thing to notice, for mental-math purposes, is that 1000 is about 1024 and 1,000,000 is about 1,048,576. Or, to round things off a bit: 2^10 = 10^3, 2^20 = 10^6, and so on.

This allows you to move back and forth between doublings and common numbers with a little practice. Thus, 2^23 must equal 2^3 times 2^10 times 2^10, and by substituting 10^3 for 2^10, we can say that 2^23 = 2^3 times 10^6, or eight million. If you're following along with a calculator, you'll notice the errors, but don't worry about them for now.

Likewise, you can do the same thing backwards. For something to multiply by 7 billion, for example, how many times must it double? 7 billion is 7 times 10^9, and thus 7 times 2^30. And since 7 is between 2^2 and 2^3, multiplying something by 7 billion requires between 22 and 23 doublings. So a process by which something doubles once a century will take 2200 years and change to multiply 7-billion-fold.

The next tool is the rule of 72, which is the key to converting to and from percentage changes and doubling. The rule is that, if something growth at x percent per unit, then it will take 72 over x units to double. So something that grows 2% per year, like the hourly productivity of workers in technologically leading modern societies, it will double every 36 years. That's about three doublings per century, so in the 200 years of modern economic growth, the richest countries will have seen six doublings of productivity, or 64-fold growth over 200 years.

So you can start working out, in your head, the way that relatively small incremental changes add up to the fundamental transformation of the world. Here's another. Suppose one person has a communicable disease, and the number of people with it grows an average of 10% per week. By the law of 72, that's about a doubling every 10 weeks, five doublings a year, and thus ten doublings every two years. Ten doublings is multiplication by one thousand, so it would take a little over six years for the entire world to catch the disease in question.

More relevantly, consider the coronavirus. If one person had it in November 2019, and it doubled its number of hosts every week, to reach all the world, given unconstrained growth, would have taken 22 to 23 weeks. Of course, there are in the real world complications, like mitigation strategies, contact tracing, weather, masks, and vaccines. But a little simple mental math can help give you an intuition for where things are going if something doesn't stop them.

# Far Side, The

Gary Larson's _The Far Side_ is one of the various curiosities that my grandfather Henderson introduced me to when I was young. He had a book of Gary Larson's comics as part of the his massive personal library. Like many good things, _The Far Side_ has found its way to the internet, where it can be seen here.

# FSI Language Courses

There is a provision in law -- I'm not intimately familiar with the details -- that has the effect of causing works produced by the US government to fall into the public domain. The US government, after all, is funded by tax-payers, and copyright is generally intended to protect the financial interests of authors, so there is an argument that the public has already bought the rights to things produced by the federal government.

The result of this is that certain language self-study courses, originally used for government officials, are allowed to circulate freely on the internet. An example is the [Hebrew course](https://fsi-languages.yojik.eu/languages/FSI/fsi-hebrew.html), which I found very useful back in my Hebrew-studying days. They are not trendy, or beautiful, or complete -- they consist of a text which introduces simple conversations in the language, and a set of tapes, along with instructions on how to study. But if the Hebrew text is any indication, they really do help with grasping the very basics of a language when you're starting.

# Gesenius, Wilhelm

Wilhelm Gesenius was -- I am probably quoting someone who I can't remember any more verbatim -- the father of biblical Hebrew lexicography. He produced a celebrated grammar of biblical Hebrew in 1813, which continued to go through various editions during his life. Strikingly for such an early academic work in a well-studied field, his _Grammar_ continues to be used in contemporary academic settings despite the publication of a number of other worthy grammars since.

# GitHub tutorial

(2020-11-5) I recently started keeping track of my website on GitHub ([here](https://github.com/mitchellbpowell/website)), and getting up and running was made easier by a nifty [tutorial](https://product.hubspot.com/blog/git-and-github-tutorial-for-beginners) produced by Meghan Nelson.

# Gregg shorthand

In 1888, Robert Gregg invented a nifty way to write things down really, really fast. Even if you don't want to learn the whole system, you could learn the way to write some common words in it. If you find yourself needing to take notes while people talk frequently, it's very helpful. See [Wikipedia's article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gregg_shorthand) on it, and a sample [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gregg_shorthand#/media/File:Gregg_shorthand_A_Christmas_Carol.jpg).

# Harris, Judith Rich

Judith Rich Harris wrote the groundbreaking _The Nurture Assumption_, in which she argued, with a great deal of evidence, that heredity is much more important than commonly imagined, and childrearing much less, in explaining personality variations in human beings. Her conclusions were by no means unanimously received without protest, and people continue to argue about these things, but the publication of her book did mark a milestone in the everlasting nature-nurture debate which has raged ever since Galton coined the term.

# Hofstadter, Douglas

Douglas Hofstadter wrote _[Gödel, Escher, Bach: An Eternal Golden Braid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%B6del,_Escher,_Bach)_. It is an absolutely fascinating look at meaning and self-reference. I really need to read it again and see if I can understand it next time. For those those who read _GEB_ and, like myself, are left perplexed, there's always his _I Am a Strange Loop_, which explains some of the underlying ideas in a much clearer format, although missing quite a bit of the entertainment value and acid-tripesque quality of _GEB_.

Sam Harris, in _Waking Up_, takes Hoftstadter to task over a passage in which Hoftstadter dismisses as childish Douglas Harding's musings on "having no head". You can find Harris's defense of headlessness on p. 144 of _Waking Up_, and Hofstadter's attack on headlessness on pp. 23-33 of Hofstadter and Dennett's _The Mind's I: Fantasies and Reflections on Self and Soul_ (Basic Books, 1981). 

# HyperCard

[HyperCard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HyperCard) was a really neat program that used to ship on Mac computers, but now it is gone. There's an interesting [conspiracy theory](https://apple.slashdot.org/story/11/11/30/1720214/why-was-hypercard-killed) about it. Thanks to growing up with a couple 1983 Macs in the house, I got to experience HyperCard before we had the internet in the house. You could make little objects move about, and factor numbers, and produce lists of prime numbers, or what have you. Kids today don't have that chance. Rest in peace, HyperCard.

# Jaynes, Julian

Perhaps one of the more puzzling and interesting books I've ever read is Julian Jaynes's _The Origin of Consciousness in the Breakdown of the Bicameral Mind_. Drawing extensively on ancient literature, Jaynes outlines a theory of what consciousness is, where it came from, and how very ancient and more modern people's minds differ. I find it impossible to accept that his theory is correct -- it seems outlandish and difficult to prove -- but it's difficult not to think that Jaynes was on to _something_.

# Jimmy

The English name *Jimmy* must be derived from *Jim*. And *Jim*, in turn, is a nickname for *James*. In older English, James was spelled *Iames*, before "J" was invented. That came from the French name *Iames*. The *-co-* just got swallowed up in the shortening, while the *-es* is just a common way for Old French masculine words to end. The French name, in turn, was a shortened version of the Vulgar Latin *Iacomus*. *Iacomus*, in turn, was a modified version of *Iacobus*, as it appeared in Late Latin. The Latin term comes from Greek Ἰάκωβος, *Iakobos*. And that comes from the Hebrew יַעֲקֹב, which is pronounced something like *Yaʿakov*. 

*Yaʿakov* to "Jimmy" is a long march, but it happens little by little.

# Life before the internet

I was born in 1991, and am seventeen years older than my youngest brother. In some ways we were raised similarly, but there's one major difference. I first had internet access at home when I was sixteen or so, while he has never known a world without the internet present. I am, from his standpoint, a dinosaur.

When I was perhaps ten, we got our first pair of computers, two Macs from 1983 which couldn't connect to the internet or display color, but which worked fine and booted up in a few seconds. Most importantly, they had HyperCard, which me and another brother used to learn some rudimentary programming skills. Later, another computer, also old and unable to connect to the internet, allowed us to start messing around with visual basic. Internet connections, for me, came from the library. At fifteen, I started a website, oriented around religious topics. I paid for web hosting by check. I made my files in HTML, first raw and later with a free WYSIWYG editor called CoffeeCup. Because I still didn't have the internet at home, I would take a flashdrive to a public library computer, and each time I wanted to update the website I would install a program on the library computer that could handle FTP transfers, send my HTML files off to the internet, and leave them there.

I learned about BASIC and HTML through physical books at public libraries, and would take a bus to get there. To make the money that paid for the web hosting and other things, I would deliver pizza, which I did without a cell phone or GPS. I had a physical map of my hometown, used flashcards to memorize the locations of all the streets, and that was that. None of this would make any sense to people ten years younger.

# Life expectancy: <br>average was not typical till recently

It is often said that, in 1850 or two thousand years ago or whenever, life expectancy was 28 or 43 or what have you, and that therefore a 25-five-year-old was "old" in those days. This is then used to make some sort of observation about early marriage, or divorce, or life insurance, or some other topic. This line of talking contains one truth and one major misconception, and it revolves around a confusion of the typical with the mathematical average (mean).

Consider the case of a hypothetical society in which half of the people who are born die at two years old of the, say, _two-year-old flu_, while the other half survive their toldlerhood and die at sixty-eight. We would not say, in a society like that, that a thirty-three-year-old was an old person, with two years left to live. A thirty-three-year-old would still be fairly young.

# Life expectancy: <br>most people beat it these days

One might be forgiven for thinking that life expectancy is how long a person can expect to live. As a crude approximation, that's right. But life expectancy is a product of current statistics, not a product of an intelligent forecast. Right now, as of 2020, there is a death rate for each age. So many one year-olds die out of the whole population, so many two-year-olds die out of the whole population, and so on.

The statistic we call a life expectancy is based on how long a person currently alive might be expected to live _on the assumption that today's numbers stay the same into the future_. But for the last two hundred years or so, today's numbers _don't_ usually hold true into the future. Death rates have usually been dropping, which means that life expectancy has usually been an _underestimate_ of how long a person will live.

# Logical quotations

I am a proud American, and I love my country. Still, I don't like what we do with quotation marks, where commas and other bits that aren't part of the quotation in any logical sense. In the ongoing effort to promote a more perfect union for ourselves and our posterity, I plan on using [logical quotation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Manual_of_Style#Punctuation_inside_or_outside) whenever I can get away with it.

# Pinker, Steven

Steven Pinker, in addition to his career as a psycholinguist, wrote _The Better Angels of Our Nature_ (2011), which chronicles the long-term reduction in violence that has occurred across human history. He followed this up with _Enlightenment Now_ (2018), which follows similar improvements across many other domains. Other books of his include _The Language Instinct_, _How the Mind Works_, and _The Sense of Style_.

# Poverty: good luck measuring it

I spent the first sixteen years of my life in a household underneath the income level that the United States government calls "the poverty line". And there was some truth to it -- there was not a whole lot of money floating around the household. And now I live a comfortable middle-class existence, my brothers include a doctor and a lawyer, my three sisters are in college and on the path to bachelors' degrees, and the two boys still under eighteen are both on a promising path themselves. And yet the Powells are by no means an inspirational story of overcoming poverty, because we never really lived with the package of issues commonly known as poverty, at least not for the most part.

Among other things, both of my parents have bachelors degrees, all four grandparents are or were college-educated, two of the grandparents having master's degrees. Before I entered the public school system in the sixth grade, I had learned algebra from my father, learned to do square roots by hand from my grandfather, and done fairly well in a college geology class I audited. My parents were and are happily married throughout my childhood and after, I had access to excellent schooling, and my childhood was free of the evictions, debt collectors, and financial desperation that tend to characterize poverty.

We spoke middle-class English at home -- gerunds ended in "-ing" rather than "-in", double negatives and non-standard past tenses were nowhere to be found, and, unlike half of Harvard graduates, every Powell child probably knows that seasons are caused by the tilt of the earth's axis. We can all -- including the one Powell sibling who has frequent psychotic episodes -- walk into a job interview without worrying about making the kinds of subtle class tells that many of our childhood neighbors have to worry about.

We were, in short, raised in a middle-class family that happened to be poor. When a Raj Chetty or combs through data on social mobility, the Powells will probably be counted as an exceptionally upwardly mobile "poor" family. I suspect that a fair number of the "high-achieving poor", if looked at carefully, are cases like ours. The data on social mobility may exaggerate how easy it is to escape poverty.

This sort of thing is part of why I distrust the tendency in academic publishing to use the term "socio-economic status" when "income" is really meant. Even when we lived in a low-income neighborhood, we were always in some sense tourists in poverty, placed there by religious beliefs that caused my parents to have nine children and to make different career decisions than most mothers and fathers do. We were, in fact, raised in privilege, not compared to the American upper-middle class by any stretch, but definitely in comparison to most children in Cincinnati's Price Hill. 

All this is to say, when you talk about poverty, try and think about what you mean. Income is part of it, but so is education, dialect, neighborhood, family structure, and worldview. And it wouldn't hurt to read _Hillbilly Elegy_.

# Project Euler

In middle school and hi school, I was what some might call a _mathlete_, one of the kids who was always running about to school math competitions. Lindsay Lohan introduces the concept [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EligNcjdyyI). Back in 2006, I somehow stumbled into being one of six Ohio high schoolers to qualify for the USAMO ([source](https://www.maa.org/math-competitions/2006-usamo-qualifiers-by-state#oh)), where I immediately found myself out of my depth and got something like two out of forty-two questions correct. I don't remember the exact figure.

Anyhow, around age 15 I got swept into studying the Hebrew Bible, which I kept picking away at until 21, and mostly left math behind. However, last year I did pick up playing around with math questions again, with Project Euler, which combines math and programming to produce puzzles to solve. If you're a former mathlete who needs a little mental stimulation now and then, you might want to give Project Euler a look. The questions are graduated in difficulty, running from the very first problem, which has been solved by 965,090 users, to some of the latest, with less than 200 users solving.

# Reading direction in English

It is a commonplace claim, and almost entirely true, that Hebrew is read from right to left, while English is read from left to right. But read this: "\$5". If you read it as "five dollars", you read the item on the right, then the item on the left. Language rules are made to be broken.

# Regression to the mean

Suppose you take a population and look at, say, a group of people with very high math scores -- perhaps they average at the 95th percentile for the general population. Then look at their children. You'll find that those children tend to score above average in math scores, but not, on average, as high as their parents. A similar phenomenon will be found if you select people with very low math scores -- their children will also tend to have lower math scores than average, but higher than their parents.

The point where this becomes counter-intuitive is that it works in both directions. If you take a group of children whose math scores deviate from the average -- above or below -- *their* parents will, on average, be closer to the average than their children. If you don't have an understanding of how regression works, you'll misunderstand some things: examples can be found on the [Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_toward_the_mean#Misunderstandings).

# Singapore's economy

Lee Kuan Yew, the first leader of modern Singapore, held various positions in government from 1959 to his death in 2015. In 1960, Singapore's GDP per capita, measured in 2018 US dollars, was $428. Upon his death in 2015, it was $55,646, a 130-fold increase ([source](https://www.google.com/search?channel=fs&client=ubuntu&q=singapore+gdp+per+capita)). To the best of my knowledge, there is no other country with a growth record exceeding that. A worthwhile read is Lee Kuan Yew's autobiography, _The Singapore Story: Memoirs of Lee Kuan Yew_. 

# Velikovsky, Immanuel

One of the many interesting curiosities that my late grandfather Henderson pointed me towards was book called _Worlds in Collision_ by the extraordinarily eccentric Immanuel Velikovsky, who combined a creative and well-read mind with a fundamental inability to understand how the real world works and produced fascinating attempts at re-writing history. If you enjoy that sort of thing, you might enjoy _Worlds in Collision_.

# Venezuela

With a few very brief exceptions, I spent the first five years of my life in Venezuela, which was a more or less functional country in the early 1990's. It had poverty, it had violence, and it had corruption, but the stores generally had food in them, the water was turned on at least part of the day, and one could walk around Venezuela for ten years through some fairly rough neighborhoods on a regular basis and only have a gun pointed at one twice. My family continues to have friends who live in the slums of Caracas, and the incredibly bleak picture of starvation, hyperinflation, and mass flight from the country that you often see in media outlets is accurate.

The descent into total dysfunction did not happen all at once. One might date it from the time when Hugo Chávez declared an "economic war" on 2020-6-2, or to the accession of Venezuelan President and now dictator Nicolás Maduro in 2013. In any case, the vicious sociopath currently oppressing Venezuela has shown every indication throughout his entire tenure that he is fully prepared to starve people out of the country until Venezuela is emptied or he is dead.

# Vim

*2020-11-21*

For years, my answer to "Vim or Emacs" has been "Whatever the default text editor in Ubuntu is -- is it still gedit?" However, a brother of mine has informed me that it's time to start acting like a grown-up and learn my way around Vim. So far, I've found that having to constantly look up the shortcuts makes the whole editing process inefficient, but I'm told that all those will eventually settle into my thick skull and everything will be quite smooth. Back in the eighth grade, I was informed by a typing teacher that it's not really the keyboard so much as it is the mouse that leads to repetitive stress injuries. Whether it's true or not, I do tend to find moving from keyboard to mouse annoying.

# WP:PAG

I used to edit quite a bit for Wikipedia, until I got tired of it. In that time, I became familiar with Wikipedia's Policies and Guidelines, known by the shortcut [WP:PAG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Policies_and_guidelines). If you ever wondered how such a massive site maintains a more or less consistent styles and keeps a pretty decent quality, WP:PAG is part of it.

# XKCD

The classic "webcomic of romance sarcasm, math, and language" needs no introduction, unless you've never heard of it. You can find it [here](https://xkcd.com/) and in-depth explanations of the jokes [here](https://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/Main_Page).
